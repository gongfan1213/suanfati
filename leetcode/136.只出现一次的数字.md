 * Explanation:
 * The XOR operation has the following properties:
 * 1. x ^ x = 0  (A number XORed with itself is 0)
 * 2. x ^ 0 = x  (A number XORed with 0 is itself)
 * 3. x ^ y = y ^ x (XOR is commutative)
 *
 * By XORing all the numbers in the array, the numbers that appear twice will cancel each other out (because x ^ x = 0).
 * The only number remaining will be the single number that appeared only once.

**Explanation and Why XOR Works:**

The provided solution uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) which is very efficient for this problem.  Here's a breakdown of why XOR works so well:

1. **XOR cancels out duplicates:** When you XOR a number with itself, the result is always 0.  Since every number in the input array appears twice *except* for the single number we're looking for, all the duplicates will effectively "cancel" each other out through the XOR operations.

2. **XOR with 0 is the identity:**  XORing any number with 0 results in the original number.  This is important because our `result` variable is initialized to 0. As we iterate through the array and XOR each element with `result`, the single number (which doesn't have a duplicate to cancel it out) will eventually be XORed with 0, effectively storing it in the `result` variable.

3. **XOR is commutative:** The order in which we XOR the numbers doesn't matter.  This allows us to simply iterate through the array once, XORing each element with the current `result`.

Because of these properties, after iterating through the entire array, the `result` variable will hold the value of the single number that appeared only once.


This method fulfills the requirements of the problem:

* **Linear Time Complexity: O(n)** - We iterate through the array only once.
* **Constant Space Complexity: O(1)** - We only use a single variable (`result`) to store the intermediate and final results, regardless of the input array's size.
